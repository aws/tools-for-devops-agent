# Changelog

## 1.0.0 (2026-08-20)

Initial release.

Workflow:
- 5-phase workflow: Scope -> Discover -> Classify -> Calculate -> Report
- Works in regular Chat (ad-hoc) or as a Custom Agent (scheduled)
- Defaults to scanning all associated accounts, all regions (no confirmation gate); announces scope and estimates scan size with a large-scope heads-up (>10 accounts)

Discovery:
- Services: EKS, RDS/Aurora, Lambda, ElastiCache, OpenSearch
- RDS covers standalone instances AND Aurora clusters (`DescribeDBClusters`, authoritative cluster EngineVersion)
- ElastiCache covers redis, valkey, and memcached across node clusters (`DescribeCacheClusters`), replication groups (`DescribeReplicationGroups`), and serverless caches (`DescribeServerlessCaches`)
- Lambda deprecated-runtime detection verified at runtime (no hardcoded runtime list)
- Mandatory pagination across all discovery APIs
- Discovery summary proves which APIs ran and accounts for SUPPORTED resources (not just affected ones)

Classification & pricing:
- EOS status: IN_EXTENDED_SUPPORT, APPROACHING_EOS, PAST_EXTENDED_SUPPORT, SUPPORTED
- Per-version EOS date verification from AWS documentation (no guessing, no date-bleed across versions/engines)
- OpenSearch Elasticsearch vs OpenSearch engine families verified independently (separate EOS calendars)
- Live pricing from the AWS Pricing API (`pricing:GetProducts`); never hardcoded
- Region prefix resolved via `pricing:GetAttributeValues`; RDS ExtendedSupport usagetype is region-prefix-free (regionCode filter only)
- OpenSearch NIH derived from instance type x count; small/micro sizes doc-verified, never extrapolated
- Year 1/2 vs Year 3 tiered pricing (boundary at >= 24 months); Multi-AZ cost doubling for RDS
- `jmespath_filter` guidance to avoid dumping large PriceList payloads

Reporting:
- Reactive (current) vs proactive (projected) cost split with cost-cliff metric
- CSV artifact with per-resource breakdown, `es_year` sentinel `N/A` for APPROACHING_EOS, and upgrade recommendations
- Documentation/upgrade lookups via `verify_aws_claim`
- Lambda deprecated runtimes flagged as security risk (no ES charge)
