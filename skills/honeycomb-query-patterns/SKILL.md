# Honeycomb Query Patterns

Requires the Honeycomb connector in the Agent Space, with its read tools enabled.

Opinionated guidance for writing effective Honeycomb queries. The MCP tools already
document their parameters and schemas — this skill focuses on *when* and *why* to
use each pattern, not *how* to call the tools.

## Key Principles

1. **Never use AVG for latency** — AVG hides tail latency. Use P99 (or P95/P90) to see what slow users experience. Reserve AVG for non-latency metrics like payload size.
2. **Use HEATMAP for distributions** — Single-number aggregates hide bimodal patterns. HEATMAP reveals whether you have one population or two.
3. **Combine calculations in one query** — `COUNT, P99(duration_ms), HEATMAP(duration_ms)` in a single query reduces API calls and gives a complete picture.
4. **Start broad, narrow with WHERE** — Begin with a COUNT/GROUP BY to understand shape, then add filters to focus.
5. **Check for prior work** — Call `find_queries` before writing new queries. Someone may have already answered the question.

## Choosing the Right Operation

| Question | Use |
|----------|-----|
| How much traffic? | `COUNT` grouped by route or service |
| How many unique users/IPs? | `COUNT_DISTINCT(field)` |
| How fast for most users? | `P50(duration_ms)` |
| How fast for the worst-off users? | `P99(duration_ms)` |
| Is there a bimodal pattern? | `HEATMAP(duration_ms)` |
| What's the worst case? | `MAX(duration_ms)` |
| How many concurrent operations? | `CONCURRENCY` |
| Is it getting worse over time? | `RATE_AVG(duration_ms)` |

## Relational Field Strategy

Use relational prefixes to ask cross-span questions within a trace:

- **"Show me slow endpoints caused by a specific downstream"**: Filter with `any.service.name` to find traces where that service participates, group by `root.http.route` to see which user-facing endpoints are affected.
- **"What's different about errored traces?"**: Filter with `any.error = true`, group by `root.name` to see which entry points have errors somewhere in their trace tree.
- **Exclude noise**: `none.service.name = "health-check"` removes traces containing health checks.

## Calculated Fields

Calculated fields are per-event expressions evaluated at query time. They transform,
classify, and combine existing fields without re-instrumenting code.

**Three scopes** — choose the narrowest that fits the need:
- **Query-scoped** (not saved): exploratory, one-off analysis
- **Dataset-level** (saved): reusable within one service's dataset
- **Environment-level** (saved): reusable across all datasets (e.g., `error_pct`)

**Common patterns:**
- **Error rate**: `MUL(IF($error, 1, 0), 100)` → use `AVG(error_pct)` to get percentage
- **Status classification**: `IF(GTE($http.status_code, 500), "5xx", GTE($http.status_code, 400), "4xx", "ok")`
- **Latency bucketing**: `BUCKET($duration_ms, 500, 0, 3000)`
- **Prefix routing**: `IF(STARTS_WITH($url, "/admin"), "admin", STARTS_WITH($url, "/api"), "api", "other")`
- **Exact-match classification**: use `SWITCH` instead of `IF(EQUALS(...))` chains — same expression, more efficient

**Key guardrails:**
- **Don't create presentational (alias-only) fields** — a field that just renames another field adds no analytical value and clutters the schema. Only save a calculated field when it does real computation (classification, extraction, math).
- **Avoid regex on large/complex fields** — running `REG_MATCH`, `REG_VALUE`, or `REG_COUNT` on `exception.stacktrace`, `db.statement`, or full log lines can be very slow. Check whether a more targeted OTel field exists first (`exception.type`, `exception.message`, `db.operation`). If you must regex a long field, guard it with a `CONTAINS` check first.
- **`EQUALS` has strict type matching** — `EQUALS($http.status_code, 200)` silently returns false if the field is stored as a string. Use `find_columns` to verify the field type before comparing.
- **`FORMAT_TIME` is expensive** — avoid in high-volume queries.
- **Save query-scoped, not dataset-level, for one-off work** — saved fields show up in everyone's schema.

`references/calculated-fields.md`.

## Before Every Query

- **Filter on `is_root`** when measuring user-facing latency — without it, internal spans inflate the numbers
- **Use human-readable time ranges** (`"24h"`, `"-6h"`) — epoch timestamps are error-prone and hard to review
- **Validate columns with `find_columns` before querying** — confirms field names exist and prevents empty results

## Interpreting Results

After running a query, the MCP tool returns formatted markdown plus metadata.
The most important metadata field is `query_result_json` — a signed URL to the raw
JSON result. For precise analysis, download it and parse with jq or python rather
than relying solely on the ASCII rendering.

Key interpretation rules:
- **P99/P50 > 10x** — bimodal distribution likely; run HEATMAP to confirm
- **TOTAL row** in breakdown results = aggregate across all groups
- **OTHER row** = groups beyond the query limit (increase limit if OTHER is large)
- **ASCII heatmap** `▁▂▃▄▅▆▇█` = density from low to high; two bands = two populations
- **query_run_pk** in metadata — feed directly to `run_bubbleup` for outlier analysis
